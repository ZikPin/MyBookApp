# MyBookApp
## Description
It is a small side project for SoftwareDev practice. A small book-blog (i.e., Bookmonkey-Api to Book gallery lol).
Let's see how big this project gets :)

## Setup and stacks
For this project, I am using:
- Angular: frontend
  - Primeng for UI Library
  - Quil for text editing
- Spring: backend
- Postgress: DB

## Plans for new features
- A dynamically generated page for each component
- Pagination
- Lazy loading
- Contact form to suggest new Books
- AI reviews and/or summaries of the books and etc.
