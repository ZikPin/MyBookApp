# MyBookApp
## Description
It is a small side project for SoftwareDev practice. In theory it should retrieve data from DB and render a small book-blog out of it.
Let's see how big the project gets :)

## Setup and stacks
For this project, I am using:
- Angular: frontend
  - Primeng for UI Library
  - Quil for text editing
- JSON-Server: mock-backend and DB (will be replaced by Spring and Postgress)

## Plans for new features
- A dynamically generated page for each component
- Pagination
- Lazy loading
- Contact form to suggest new Books
- AI reviews and/or summaries of the books and etc.
